      <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
      <p>
        Maarten de Goede, Sven Hoffmann and Imani Dap (collectively known as "melonmelon", "we", "our", "us") respect the
        privacy of our users ("user", "you", "your"). This Privacy Policy
        describes how we treat your personal information when you use our
        website, mobile application, as well as any other related, linked, or
        otherwise connected to product (the "Apps"). By accessing and using the
        Apps, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
      </p>

        Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. If you do not agree with the
        terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not access the Apps.
      </p>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time
        and for any reason. We will inform you about any changes by updating the
        “Last updated” date of this Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <p>

        be subject to, and will be deemed to have accepted the changes in any
        revised Privacy Policy by your continued use of the Apps after the date
        such revised Privacy Policy is posted.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party online/mobile
        stores from which you install the Apps or make payments, which may also

        social media, e-mail, or any other communication service, you agree that
        your contact information, message(s), as well as any other information

        Apps. We do not share this analytical data with any third parties, and
        only use the analytical data for improving your experience when using
        the Apps.
      </p>

      </p>

      <h3>By Law or to Protect Rights</h3>

      <p>
        If we believe the release of information about you is necessary to
        respond to legal process, to investigate or remedy potential violations
        of our policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of
        others, we may share your information as permitted or required by any
        applicable law, rule, or regulation.

        your information. Before visiting and providing any information to any
        third-party websites, you should inform yourself of the privacy policies
        and practices (if any) of the third party responsible for that website,
        and should take those steps necessary to, in your discretion, protect
        the privacy of your information. We are not responsible for the content
        or privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties,
        including other sites, services or Applications that may be linked to or

        to secure the personal information you may provide to us, please be
        aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or
        impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed
        against any interception or other type of misuse. Any information
        disclosed online is vulnerable to interception and misuse by
        unauthorized parties. Therefore, we cannot guarantee complete security
        if you provide personal information.
